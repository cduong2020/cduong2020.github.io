        <h1>Winter Forgetfulness</h1>

        <p>
            If one is attending school, there is usually a break called “Winter Break”. This is the 
            longest break other than summer break. Since a break is long, there is a potential to 
            forget information. I have seen this occur. 
            <br />
            With the current restrictions, my younger 
            sibling rarely interacts with their classmates. Currently, school is virtual. When winter 
            break came, a lot of time was spent in the house. For around two weeks, my sibling did 
            not see any classmates. 
            <br />
            So, when school returned, some names where forgotten. The conversation when like this. <br />
            “Pick someone from the class to share next,” said the teacher. <br />
            “Hmmm. I see people raising their hands,” my sibling stated. <br />
            “Choose one,” replied the teacher. <br />
            “…I forgot their names…,” my sibling quietly whispered. <br />
            As it can be seen, winter forgetfulness can certainly happen. <br />
