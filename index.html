            Welcome to the website!
            <br /><br />
            This blog will be covering a variety of interesting topics that people could find enjoyable. 
            It could be said that this is a lifestyle/informative blog. I will not be saying that this is 
            a lifestyle to follow. But instead, I will be illustrating the currently lifestyle that I take 
            part in. The topics I will be providing in this blog are stories (anecdotes from my experience) 
            and anime.
        </p>
        <p>
            As stated earlier, the stories that will be posted are anecdotal. It will include funny things 
            that I have experienced, which usually involves my family or friends. It can also include internal 
            musings that I find insightful and meaningful. Every story and every situation are a learning experience. 
            I want to provide stories for people to find their own takeaways. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Another topic of discussion is anime. For a comparison, anime is the Japanese version of a “cartoon” 
            series. The most amazing shows can be found. They can be cute and fluffy or action-packed. There is 
            plenty of content and genres that people can select. I will be providing some reviews on animes that 
            I found enjoyable.
            <br />
            <br />
            Hopefully, this website ends up being a great learning resource for me and for you to enjoy!
        </p>
